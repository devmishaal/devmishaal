Hey there! I am Mishal Ibrar 👋 

💡 What I'm all about I am a React Native developer with 1 year of hands-on experience. I make clean and user-friendly mobile applications. I have good front-end flair with strong backend logic, and an aesthetic eye as a designer comes in handy in the development of UIs that feel good as much as they look. 

With a growth mindset and curiosity, I am a bit crazy about self-learning and always up to finding the next new technical frontier that will challenge and excite me. 

🌱 Currently exploring 

Mobile application development with React Native 

Best practices for User Interface/ User Experience in fashion and e-commerce apps 

Geo-location and filter integration in the mobile app 

🛠️ My toolbox 

const mySkills = { 
  frontend: ['React-Native'], 
  backend: ['Express.js', 'SQL', Fisebase], 
  languages: ['JavaScript', 'TypeScript'], 
}; 
  

💼 A few cool things I have accomplished in my life 

I have built mobile applications encompassing components such as intro sliders, modals, carousels, and geolocation filters. 

Designed prototype UI designs based on Behance and other great design platforms. 

Gatsby Store: built an app for a clothing store with reusable components and performance requirements. 

I keep upgrading my skills through various hands-on projects and personal learning. 

With all the prowess of balancing coding with a splash of creativity. 🎨👩‍💻
